# UnlockAllTilesMod
 
Unlocks all 529 tiles for Cities Skylines II maps and reduces their cost to $0.

The tiles will be available for "purchase" after hitting the first milestone.

# Installation
1. Remove BepInEx 5 if you have that installed. Otherwise, proceed to step 2

   * To remove BepInEx 5, you need to delete the `BepInEx` folder, the `doorstop_config.ini` file, and the `winhttp.dll` file from your game's installation directory

2. Install [BepInEx 6 Bleeding Edge build](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be)

   * The pre-release version of BepInEx 6 available on their GitHub release page is quite outdated (dated August 2022) and does not support loading this mod. Please download the Bleeding Edge version from [their website](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be)

   * Download `BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-be.674+82077ec.zip` (or a newer version), and unzip all of its contents into the game's installation directory, typically `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Cities Skylines II`

   * The installation directory should now have the `BepInEx` folder, the `doorstop_config.ini` file, and the `winhttp.dll` file

3. Run the game once, then close it. You can close it when the main menu appears

4. Download the mod from the [release page](https://github.com/Wayzware/UnlockAllTilesMod/releases). Unzip it into the `Cities Skylines II/BepInEx/plugins` folder

5. Launch the game, mods should be loaded automatically
